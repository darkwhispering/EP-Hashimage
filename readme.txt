Requires at least: 3.3.0
Tested up to: 3.4.2
Stable tag: 3.1.1

Display image by hashtag from twitter or instagram in your template, post/page or widget area using template tag, shortcode or the widget.

== Description ==

This plugin search after hashtagged images on twitter and/or Instagram.

The Twitter search can fetch images from the following networks in the twitter search result.

* twitpic
* instagram
* yfrog
* plixi
* flickr
* pic.twitter.com.

URLâ€™s are being curled and cached for 10-12 minutes using the Wordpress Transients API.

The plugin, when enabled, exposes a template tag which you can add to your theme:

`<?php
if(function_exists('hashimage')){
 echo hashimage('hashtag=unicorn&limit=5');
}
?>`

or you use the shortcode in your post and pages

`[hashimage hashtag="unicorn" limit="5"]`

or add the widget in any of your widget areas.

You will get an optionpage in the settings meny section with settings for thumbnails sizes in widget and shortcode. There is also an option for async loading, with that on `true` your page will load faster, show image in lightbox or original source, what network to search in and if the plugin should autoload every 15 min.

Some notes/known bugs:

* The Twitter API only returns the latest results when searching on hashtag, so the result set is limited due to this.
* The Instagram API required a client_id that you need to get from http://instagram.com/developer/
* The Instagram API limits the search result to around max 20 images right now.
* A documentation page is on the why with better info on how to use the plugin.
* This beta will break old settings! Make sure you go over your settings again.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The hashimage dont show anything! =

If the plugin don't show anything for you this is probably due to that the search result from twitter it empty. Test with another hashtag or do a search in twitter.com with the hashtag you want to use. If there is no results on twitter.com you found why the plugin is blank on your site.

= A search on twitter give results but I'm not getting anything on my site. =

If you are using version 2.3.0, please upgrade to the latest version. the 2.3.0 version has a bug in the async option that can cause this behavior.

If you are running the latest version, try to deactivate all other plugins to see if that help. Also check that the uploads folder have read/write permissions.

= I'm getting a lot of broken links. =

The plugin stores the cache folder in wordpress uplaods folder. If you get broken images the plugin is unable to create the cache files. Make sure that the uploads folder is read/writable.

*The versions below 2.3.3 of the plugin used the webservers default temp folder as cache folder. For the most the will work perfect, but in some cases it might not and you end up with broken images as result. A quick fix for this is to go into the plugin folder and change the cache folder path in timthumb-config.php. This might be updated as an option in the settings page in the future.*
