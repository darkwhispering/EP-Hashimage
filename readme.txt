**APLHA** Display image by hashtag from twitter or instagram in your template, post/page or widget area using template tag, shortcode or the widget.

== Description ==

**ALPHA release Version 5.0.0.a01**

**ABOUT**

This plugin search after hashtagged images on twitter and/or Instagram.

The Twitter search can fetch images from the following networks in the twitter search result.

* twitpic
* instagram
* yfrog

URL's are being curled and cached using the Wordpress Transients API.

The plugin, when enabled, exposes a template, shortcode, widget and a settings page.

**New documentation page for version 5 is available [here](http://darkwhispering.com/documentation/hashimage)**

**Some notes**

* The Twitter API required a consumer key and secret that you need to get from https://dev.twitter.com [Follow this guide](http://darkwhispering.com/how-to/get-twitter-consumer-key-and-secret ) if you don't know how to get one.
* The Twitter API only returns the latest results when searching on hashtag, so the result set is limited due to this. There are no exact limit but seems to be between 50-70. [More info here (see limitations)](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search)
* The Instagram API required a client_id that you need to get from http://instagram.com/developer/ [Follow this guide](http://darkwhispering.com/wp-plugins/ep-hashimage/get-a-instagram-client_id-key) if you don't know how to get one.
* The Instagram API limits the search result to around max 20 images! Fix might come in the future. [More info here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12322028/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-requests-for-instagram).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm getting a lot of broken links. =

The plugin stores the cache folder in wordpress uploads folder. If you get broken images the plugin is unable to create the cache files. Make sure that the uploads folder is read & writable.

= It only displayes about 50 images when I set my limit to 100+ =

Sadly, there are some limitations in both Twitter and Instagram.

Instagram only return about 20 images on a search. You can find more information about it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12322028/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-requests-for-instagram)
There is a way to get more results form instagram, but my time is limited so it have to wait for now.

Twitter only return results from the lates 6-8 days, and most of the time this result in 50 - 70 items depending on how popular hashtag you use. You can read more about this in the twitter search api documentations [here](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search)
